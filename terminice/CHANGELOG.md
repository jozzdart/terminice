## 0.0.17

Added **nested group configurables** to the config editor, enabling hierarchical settings with infinite nesting depth.

- **`GroupConfigurable`** — Groups child fields into a navigable sub-editor. Appears in the parent list with a `▸` icon and a live summary (e.g. "2/5 modified"). Press Enter to drill in, Esc or "← Back" to return. Groups can contain other groups for arbitrary nesting.
- **Shared editor loop** — Extracted the rendering, navigation, and key-handling logic into a reusable internal loop. Both the top-level `configEditor` and nested group editors share the same code path, eliminating duplication.
- **Root-only save** — Only the top-level editor shows "✓ Save & confirm". Nested editors show "← Back" instead — edits are preserved in-place and only finalized when the user confirms at the root.
- **Recursive change detection** — `GroupConfigurable.isModified` checks all descendants recursively. The `*` modified indicator propagates up through all parent groups.
- **Nested JSON serialization** — `toJsonValue()` produces nested maps and `loadJsonValue()` distributes back to children, so groups round-trip through JSON seamlessly.
- **Recursive validation** — `GroupConfigurable.validate()` aggregates errors from all children, prefixed with the child label for context.

## 0.0.16

Introduced the **Config Editor** system - a searchable, theme-aware settings editor that composes existing prompts into a unified configuration flow.

- **`configEditor`** — Keyboard-driven settings editor that presents a searchable list of typed fields. Select a field to open its dedicated prompt, then return to the list. Single terminal session with clean rendering (no leftover artifacts between edits).
- **`Configurable<T>`** — Abstract base class for typed, serializable config fields with built-in validation, formatting, change detection (`isModified`), and JSON round-tripping (`toJsonValue` / `loadJsonValue`).
- **`ConfigResult`** — Result wrapper with `toMap()` serialization, typed `get<T>(key)` access, `hasChanges`, `modified` list, and `loadFromMap()` for restoring state.
- **8 configurable types**:
  - `BoolConfigurable` — Yes/no via confirm prompt.
  - `StringConfigurable` — Single-line text or multiline editor, with placeholder and required flag.
  - `PasswordConfigurable` — Masked input with optional reveal toggle.
  - `NumberConfigurable` — Text input or slider mode, with min/max/step/unit and integer-only option.
  - `EnumConfigurable` — Searchable dropdown from a fixed set of string options.
  - `RangeConfigurable` — Dual-handle range prompt with start/end serialization.
  - `RatingConfigurable` — Star rating with optional per-level labels.
  - `ThemeConfigurable` — Live theme picker from all 11 built-in presets (or custom map). Changing the theme re-renders the editor immediately.
- **Live theme switching** — `ThemeConfigurable` fields are auto-wired so selecting a new theme updates the editor's own frame, icons, and hints in real time.
- **Focused selection** — Enum and theme selectors start the cursor on the currently active value, with a `✓` marker for quick identification.
- **Field descriptions** — Optional `description` parameter on any configurable, shown as a dim subtitle below the focused field.
- **Search on by default** — The editor starts with search enabled for fast filtering by label or key.

## 0.0.15

- No public API or behavioral changes.

## 0.0.14

- **Documentation**: Completely rewrote the `README.md` with a production-grade opening and embedded an interactive, looping VHS showcase GIF.
- **Examples**: Added a comprehensive `showcase.dart` example demonstrating multiple prompts and themes chained together.
- **Bug fix**: Fixed `multiline` prompt ignoring spacebar inputs (added `KeyEventType.space` handling).
- **Bug fix**: Fixed `multiline` prompt not exiting properly when pressing `Ctrl+D` due to incorrect key action result mapping.

## 0.0.13

- **Centralized filesystem helpers**: Shared `pathBasename`, `shortPath`, and `sortedEntries` extracted from `filePicker` and `pathPicker`, removing duplicated path and directory-listing logic.
- **Centralized indicator lifecycle**: New `IndicatorLifecycle` mixin provides `prepareFrame()`, `clear()`, and `runSession()` for all 5 indicators, eliminating duplicated `RenderOutput` management and `TerminalSession` boilerplate.
